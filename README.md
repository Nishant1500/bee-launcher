### Special Thanks to
- **[Helios Launcher](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://github.com/dscalzi/HeliosLauncher/)** For Inspiring Us To Make This Launcher. Our First Version was based on their code, just some minor changes.
- And to all other contributors! ðŸ’–

### ðŸ“Œ Additional Information
- This program doesn't have a trusted code sign certificate, so Window Defender/Antivirus might delete the file or just show a warning. Turn off Window Defender/Antivirus if the program isn't working or you can add Bee Launcher to Window Defender [Exclusions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide).

> **If we get large userbase then we will sign the program with trusted Microsoft's code signing partner**
> Or the warning will simply disappear if we get large number of downloads according to Microsoft Windows Defender/Antivirus's documentation

- This Repository Doesn't Contains The Full Source Code, the files are of v1.0.0 and it's very bad. Clone/fork if you stil want to work with those source codes
